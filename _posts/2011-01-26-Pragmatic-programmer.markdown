Couple months ago, I started reading [Pragmatic Programmer](http://www.pragprog.com/the-pragmatic-programmer) book, that in opinion of some of my colleagues is just have to read.
I did it and here I want to share with some of key ideas that maybe are not nothing new, but worth to remember if you're job is _Software Development_.

* __Take responsibility for what you are doing__ - None of us wants to work with unprofessional dudes, that seats in work and all they, and waiting for the end of the day. Think how others looks at you, and what you can improve in yourself. Start changing yourself first, then others

* __Broken window theory__ -  If you find yourself working on a project with quite a few broken windows ( part of application that's really sucks ), it's all too easy to slip into the mindset of "All the rest of this code is crap, I'll just follow suit‚Äù. So keep your code clean all the time, cause if not, then there is a short way to overtime.

* __Stone soup story__ - At the beginning it cold be hard, but synergy, co-operation of all team members is crucial.

* __Be catalyst to change__ - be proactive. If you see, that team doesn't work together, show by yourself how could it can be changed.

* __The frog problem__ - Look always on big picture, don't be only focus on what are you doing. (If you put frog in boiled watter then it jump out, but if you put it in cold, and then start warm up it, then it will boiled.)

* __Good enough__ - it's a software system design rule, to create quick, but good software.  Most user prefers good software today, than great tomorrow - so try not polish your code to much. Do as much it's needs, but not more.


* __Treat something that you don't know as challenge__. Don't allow things, that can be check in short time to wait. 

* __Diversification__ - like in financing investments, don't always stuck to one technology
  * An investment in knowledge always pays the best interests

* __DRY__ - I think it doesn't need any explanations. One of the most important thing in programming. Don't repeat yourself!.

* __Orthogonality__ - it means that two piece of code are not coupled, they are independent, and change in one won't change the behavior of other. For example, changing DB shouldn't change user interface. 

* __Testing__ - 
  At the beginning of my software developer career it was very hard to switch into mindset of TDD. Just over the years and some semi-big applications, I've learnt my lesson and have to say, that when you write tests, then you have better sleep in night:) I also noticed, that thanks 3 steps: test, implement, refactors, quality of code that I've produce increase significantly.
